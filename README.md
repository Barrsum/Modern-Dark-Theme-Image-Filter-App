## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly web interface for applying visual filters to uploaded images. Users can easily:

*   Upload an image from their device.
*   Instantly see the effects of filters in a live preview viewport.
*   Choose between applying curated **Presets** (like "Vintage", "Cool", "Dramatic") or fine-tuning filters using individual **Sliders** (Brightness, Contrast, Saturate, Blur, etc.).
*   Toggle between the Preset and Slider control views.
*   Switch between a modern **Dark Theme** (default) and a clean Light Theme.
*   Utilize utility functions like Reset Filters, Clear Image, and **Save Filtered Image**.

The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional image editing tool.

## Features

*   **Image Upload:** Select local image files (`jpg`, `png`, `webp`, etc.).
*   **Live Filter Preview:** See filter changes applied instantly in the main viewport.
*   **Dual Filter Modes:**
    *   **Presets:** Apply predefined filter combinations with a single click.
    *   **Sliders:** Fine-tune individual CSS filters (`brightness`, `contrast`, `saturate`, `grayscale`, `sepia`, `hue-rotate`, `blur`, `invert`) with range inputs.
*   **Mode Toggle:** Easily switch between Preset buttons and Slider controls.
*   **Theme Switching:** Toggle between Dark (default) and Light UI themes, with smooth transitions. Theme preference can be optionally saved in `localStorage`.
*   **Utility Controls:** Buttons for "Reset Filters", "Clear Image", and "Save Image".
*   **Save Image Functionality:** Download the currently filtered image as a PNG file using the HTML Canvas API to accurately capture applied filters.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts layout for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, and modern CSS.
*   **Iconography:** Uses `react-icons` for a cleaner UI in the footer and potentially buttons.
